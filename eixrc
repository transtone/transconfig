# /etc/eixrc
#
# In this file system-wide defaults for variables related to eix binaries
# are stored, i.e. the variables set in this file override the built-in
# defaults. Both can be overridden by ~/.eixrc and by environment variables.
#
# It is strongly recommended to set here only those variables which you
# want to *differ* from the built-in defaults (or for which you have a
# particular reason why the default should never change with an eix update).
#
# *Otherwise you might miss changes in the defaults in newer eix versions*
# which may result in confusing behavior of the eix binaries.
#
# ebuilds of <=eix-0.10.3 (and >=eix-0.7.4) used to set *all* variables in
# /etc/eixrc which is not recommended anymore. If you want to get such a file
# (i.e. a file where all variables are described and set to the current
# values resp. to the built-in default values) you can redirect the output
# of the options --dump or --dump-defaults, respectively.
#
# However once more: To avoid unexpected problems
#
#   *IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO SET _ALL_ VARIABLES* in /etc/eixrc
#
# Only set those for which you have a reason to do so!
#
# For the available variables and their defaults, see the output of the
# options --dump or --dump-defaults.
# For more detailed explanations see the manpage of eix.
