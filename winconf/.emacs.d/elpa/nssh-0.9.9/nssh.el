;;; Commentary:

;; nssh is a new SSH mode for Emacs, based on TRAMP and shell-mode. It
;; takes some inspiration and code from `ssh-mode`, by Noah Friedman.

;; `M-x nssh RET` will open a connection. If a live connection is open,
;; it will be brought to the foreground. If the buffer exists, but the
;; process is dead, it will reconnect. With a prefix argument, opens a
;; new connection.
