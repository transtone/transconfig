;;; Commentary:

;; This spot of code extends M-x man with completion of man page names and
;; filenames, and a new default page name at point which collapses hyphens
;; (like nroff uses in formatted pages) and can optionally transform some
;; perl class names.
;;
;; iman.el does similar page name completion, and with info documents too,
;; but not filename completion.  As of rev 2.22 it has the section number
;; like "cat(1)" but sets "require-match" so if you've got cat(1) and
;; catdoc(1) then you end up having to type "cat(" to differentiate, which
;; is a bit annoying.
;;
;; woman.el does a similar completion too, by going through /usr/share/man
;; etc to get a filename.  That's also what "bash_completion" does
;; (http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion).  But the strategy
;; here for man-completion.el is to ask man what pages are available, rather
;; than digging.  It can potentially get aliases man knows from its lexgrog
;; parse but which don't have symlinks (or ".so" pages).

;;; Install:

;; Put man-completion.el in one of your `load-path' directories and the
;; following in your .emacs
;;
;;     (eval-after-load "man" '(require 'man-completion))
;;
;; To use the smart perl module name at point defaulting, add also
;;
;;     (setq man-completion-at-point-functions
;;           '(man-completion-transform-perl
;;             man-completion-transform-poco))
;;
;; There's an autoload cookie for the `require' below, if you use
;; `update-file-autoloads' and friends.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 and up.  Works in XEmacs 21.
;; Probably works in Emacs 20 if you get a replace-regexp-in-string.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - avoid truncation to tty width on very long page names
;; Version 3 - new page at point transform scheme
;; Version 4 - disallow "[" except for sole "[" alias of "test(1)"
;; Version 5 - cope with non-existent `default-directory'
;; Version 6 - fix perl package name pruning when a section number too
;; Version 7 - notice man-db index file changes to refresh page names
;; Version 8 - page name completion case-insensitive
;; Version 9 - disallow "/" for page name at point
;; Version 10 - disallow dash before hyphen like "X--\nY"
;; Version 11 - add emacs23 `boundaries' in completion
;; Version 12 - :: gets perl page name mangling
;; Version 13 - tie-in to completing-help.el for page descriptions
;; Version 14 - tie-in to icicles.el help, and some bug fixes
;; Version 15 - boundaries at perl "::" separator (emacs23)
;; Version 16 - oops, boundaries wrong, want ":" delim for partial completion
;; Version 17 - complete space after any -X option
;; Version 18 - case-sensitive -l option, remove filename `boundaries'
;; Version 19 - undo defadvice on unload-feature
;; Version 20 - speedup for "[" command at point

  ;;     loosened (which would simplify the regexp too).  A ":" at the end
  ;;     is disallowed though, since that'd most often be punctuation.

  ;;   * A "::" is deliberately not matched at the end, for the benefit of
  ;;     perl code writing say Glib::Object:: for a class name.  In that

A page name at point is offered as a default, and completions

A filename can also be entered too as any of the following, with
filename completion.

    ./foo

    -l foo

An apropos query can be entered as on the \"man\" command line.

    -k foo

This is a normal feature of M-x `man', though as Emacs 23 if
there's no matches the error message is \"Can't find the -k foo
manpage\", which might make you think it tried to get a page
called \"-k\" or that man-completion has upset it, but it just
means no matches.

Page name completion is case-insensitive because \"man\" is
case-insensitive and because it helps odd combinations of
upper/lower in page names.  Filename case sensitivity follows
`read-file-name-completion-ignore-case' the same as
`read-file-name' does.

If the default page name offered is not quite right remember
the usual `\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]' puts it in the minibuffer for you to edit.

If `completing-help-mode' is enabled then page descriptions are
shown in the completions list (with `\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\\[minibuffer-completion-help]' etc).

If `icicle-mode' is enabled then page descriptions and filename
descriptions are available with the usual icicles help.
