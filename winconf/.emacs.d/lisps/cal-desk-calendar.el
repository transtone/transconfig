;; To activate this feature, include the following lines in your
;; .emacs: 
;;

;; (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'sort-diary-entries)
;; (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'fancy-schedule-display-desk-calendar t)
;;
;; It will replace the normal diary display mode when you run either the d
;; command from the Calendar buffer after M-X calendar, or when you directly
;; format your diary using M-x diary.

;; To Do:
;;
;; 1) Rewrite display engine into two separate passes.  The first
;;    builds a sorted list of appointments and the second displays it
;;    in the preferred style.  This will allow the first pass to be
;;    used for various different displays, including generation of
;;    LaTeX source for various formats.
;; 2) Write some comments describing some of the obscure portions, if
;;    they survive the rewrite.
;; 3) Add a variable to specify the increments in which the grid will
;;    be extended instead of simply using
;;    diary-schedule-interval-time.  That would allow, for example, an
;;    interval of 30 minutes, but extending the calendar in increments
;;    of an hour. 
;; 4) Add some functions that directly implement some of the recurring
;;    event options described in RFC 2446 (especially section
;;    4.8.5.4).  All of these can be constructed with sexp entries,
;;    but some of the code gets a bit hairy to embed in the diary file
;;    for each entry.  It seems better to have a library of functions
;;    like the ones that are still tagging along at the end of this
;;    file.
;; 5) Implement handling of multiple timezones explicitly.  The real
;;    problem is when the calendar dates for a particular moment in
;;    time differ between the zones.  This will probably require
;;    grabbing the events for the previous and following dates and
;;    checking their times after the TZ calculations.
;; 6) Add an escape mechanism for the time format strings, or better still,
;;    convert to the mechanism that Ed is already using in the diary code.
;; 7) Prep for internationalization.  Pull text strings out into variables.
;;    Doctor the main diary code to allow internationalization of the
;;    sunrise/sunset messages, lunar phases, solstices and equinoxes.
;; 8) Add an option for a double | for periods containing overlapping events.
;; 9) Clean up the code by making variables local where possible.
;; 10) Pull the common code for dealing with the out of range events into a
;;    separate function instead of having two identical blocks.
;; x 11) Make the | configurable.
;; 12) Add an option to allow a fixed string to replace appointment text for
;;    diary entries.  This would allow producing a calendar that indicated
;;    which times were committed and which were free without revealing the
;;    details of those appointments, suitable for mailing to someone for
;;    setting up meetings.
;; x 13) Make special time patterns (Workday, Morning, etc.) configurable.  This
;;    is important for internationalization anyway.
