;;; Commentary:

;; Version: 2
;; X-URL: http://www.lathi.net/twiki-bin/view/Main/EmacsWeeklyView

;; This package makes a bar graph of the week's diary events
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'weekly-view)
;;   (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'fancy-diary-display-week-graph)

;; Now when you view your diary it will display the weekly graph.

;;; History:
;; version 1: original code, mostly worked
;; version 2: patch from Nemeth Felician <f_nemeth@index.hu> fixes lots of bugs

;;; Code:

(require 'cal-desk-calendar)

(define-key calendar-mode-map "w" 'week-graph-view-diary-entries)


;;; User Variables:

(defcustom week-graph-work-week nil
  "*If non-nil, only the 5 workdays are displayed (instead of 7)."
  :type 'boolean)

(defcustom week-graph-dynamic-width t
  "*If non-nil, the graph fully fills the window.
If nil, `weekly-graph-day-width' is used."
  :type 'boolean)


;;; Compatibility:
;; 
;; emacs doesn't have replace-in-string
;; from gnus-util.el
