# According to RFC 1918, you can use the following IP networks for private 
# nets which will never be connected to the Internet:
#
#       10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
#       172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
#       192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255
# 10.0.0.0 2 80 29 45 07   / 73 61 52 192
# In case you want to be able to connect directly to the Internet (i.e. not 
# behind a NAT, ADSL router, etc...), you need real official assigned 
# numbers.  Do not try to invent your own network numbers but instead get one 
# from your network provider (if any) or from your regional registry (ARIN, 
# APNIC, LACNIC, RIPE NCC, or AfriNIC.)
